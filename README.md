Hangman Game
Welcome to my version of the classic Hangman game, built using React and TypeScript.

ðŸ’» Technologies
This project was created using the following technologies:
React â€” for building the user interface.
TypeScript â€” for code reliability and safety.
Vite â€” as a modern and fast build tool.
CSS Modules â€” for component styling encapsulation.

ðŸŽ® How to Play?
The player must guess a hidden word by selecting letters one by one. Each incorrect guess adds a new part to the hangman figure.
You win if you guess all the letters in the word before the figure is complete.
You lose if the hangman figure is fully drawn.
You can enter letters using the on-screen keyboard or your physical keyboard. To start a new game, press Enter.
